# E-Commerce-Shopping-Cart
This C++ project simulates an E-Commerce Shopping Cart system where users can view products, add them to their cart, remove items, and proceed to checkout. The program uses object-oriented principles with classes such as Product for items, ShoppingCart for managing the cart, and methods for adding, viewing, and removing products. Users can calculate the total cost at checkout, making it a simple yet functional e-commerce application. Itâ€™s a great way to demonstrate handling user input, managing product data, and working with basic file or cart-based operations in C++.
